## 1. What is Large Language Model
Neural Network designed to `UNDERSTAND`, `GENERATE` and `RESPOND` to human like text.

or  

Deep Neural Network trained on massive amount of text data.

## 2. What does `Large` mean in Large Language Model
Models have billions of `parameters`!
> Parameters: Number of `weights` and `biases`.

`LANGAUGE MODELS`: Only deals with language/NLP tasks.

## 3. LLM vs Earlier NLP models
NLP Models: Designed for Specific Tasks.  
LLM: Wide range of NLP tasks from same architecture.

NLP: Could not write Emails.  
LLM: Can write Emails üòÖ.

## 4. What makes LLM so good
`Transformers`

Not this one üòÅ

## 5. LLM vs GenAI vs Deep Learning vs Machine Learning

```
AI: Ruled based AI-Booking GAS using Whatsapp bot (not an ML)   
 |_ML: Involve Neural Network and others fields too, like decision tree.  
    |_DL: ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM  
       |_LLM: Doesn't deal with images   
```
`Genarative AI`: LLM+DL (also deals with image, sound etc)

## 6. Application of LLMs
